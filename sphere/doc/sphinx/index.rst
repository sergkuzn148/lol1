The sphere documentation
========================
This is the official documentation for the ``sphere`` discrete element modelling
software. This document aims at guiding the installation process, documenting
the usage, and explaining the relevant theory.

``sphere`` is developed by Anders Damsgaard as part as his Ph.D. project, under
supervision of David Lundbek Egholm and Jan A. Piotrowski, all of the Department
of Geoscience, Aarhus University, Denmark. The author welcomes interested third
party developers. This document is a work in progress.
